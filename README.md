# Project-Velocity
Prototype of a 3D Infinite Runner video game, developed in Unity for the Video Game Creation course.

# Neon Rush (3D Endless Runner Prototype)

A fast-paced 3D endless runner where speed and reflexes are the key to survival in a futuristic city. This project was developed as the Final Project for the "Video Game Creation" course.

## 📖 About The Project
**Neon Rush** is a functional prototype that puts the player in control of an agile robot running through a procedurally generated track. The objective is simple: dodge the obstacles that appear on the path by jumping and moving sideways to survive as long as possible and set a new high score.

This project was conceived and developed over one semester as the final project for the Video Game Creation course at UTEZ, under the guidance of Professor Lic. [cite_start]David Navas Landa[cite: 14].
